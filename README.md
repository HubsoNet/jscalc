## General Information
- This JS-Calculator was created for learning purpose. It supposed to imitate Windows 8.1 calculator (ver. 6.3) in basic/standard mode.
- The main goal was to implement all dependencies between its functions and "shortcuts", e.g. choosing multiplication operation and clicking Equal Key calculates successive powers of the entered number. Thus, it utilizes functions that are not for example present in calculator on Google web page.
- It was my first longer code using JavaScript. Debugging was more challenging due to higher complexity of dependencies of individual functions.


## Technologies Used
- HTML 5,
- CSS 3,
- JavaScript ES6.


## Project Status
Project as a learning exercise is completed at this moment. I moved to other studying tasks.


## Room for Improvement
Mainly tweaks in code, solving minor bugs. Some more cleaning and optimization.

To do:
- Could add handling of numpads on PC/notebook keyboard.


## Acknowledgements
